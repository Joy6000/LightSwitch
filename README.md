# FAQ
#### When will this be ready? 
I'm currently working on a project for a friend, (please check her out she's really cool https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6cIovME8Ts7OEGkLC558w) 
that I expect to be finished by the beginning of summer, and this project to be finished by the end of this year.
#### What can I expect from this?
Basically everything you need, reaction roles, moderation commands, rank system, inventory, economy, mini games, suggestion channels, and more!
#### Why are you making your entire project public?
So that people can have a better understanding of how these type of bots work.
#### Can anyone make a bot, does Discord need to give you a greenlight of some sort?
Everyone can, and you do not need any greenlight from the people at Discord.
If you want to create a Discord bot, I suggest you learn the language that your API wrapper is based on. For example Discord.js (The library and API Wrapper that is used for javascript based bot development) is based on JavaScript, therefor you should learn JavaScript first.
Same goes for Discord.py (Python) and any others.
