# Heyo!
I'm LightSwitch, a lightweight bot that is in production.
# Description
This is a private/public bot. There will be no invite, you must get this bot up and ready for your server. When this bot is complete, you'll get instructions.
# FAQ
#### When will this be ready? 
I'm currently working on a project for a friend, (please check her out she's really cool https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6cIovME8Ts7OEGkLC558w) 
that I expect to be finished by the beginning of summer, and this project to be finished by the end of this year.
#### What can I expect from this?
Basically everything you need, reaction roles, moderation commands, rank system, inventory, economy, mini games, suggestion channels, and more!
#### Why do I need to deploy this bot, and is it hard to do so?
I'd like to show you how to get a bot up and running, so you can do the same in the future. You may also use this as a prefab if you want.
